Hi! If you want to use the plugin, you have to drag and drop the downloaded JAR file into your server's plugin folder. You can then just launch the server and use /hoetool to launch the main command. MC version: 1.20-1.21.1
Dependencies: VAULT, CITIZENS, ESSENTIALSX
This plugin allows you to have your own custom hoe tool that can be upgraded. The upgrades can make you replant crops automatically, break nearby crops in some radius instantly, etc.
