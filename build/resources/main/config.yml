# You can add more levels, but not upgrades!

# The way the farmer NPC works is that he stands still and "collects" the crop you've farmed using the hoe tool.
# At the end of the npc-lifetime-seconds you'll be able to click the NPC and get the (lifetime) amount of crops,
# If you leave him hanging or leave the server during that time, you lose those rewards (he despawns after 5 min)

# This plugin depends on Citizens, EssentialsX and Vault plugins to work.
# The private tool currently works on 3 crop types: wheat, carrots & potatoes

# You need to be an operator in order to do /hoetool reload, but every player can do /hoetool.
